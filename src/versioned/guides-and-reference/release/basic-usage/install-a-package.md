# Install your first snap package!

It is now time to transform your Snappy Ubuntu Core system in an awesome arcade game machine!
You can easily install any snap through the webdm store UI.

> If you retrieved the ip in the previous step, replace **webdm.local** by the **ip address** you noted before.

## The webdm store

Ensure you have a tab opened on the **Snappy store** tab
or visit directly http://webdm.local:4200/store.

You will see there all available snaps for your release version. Note that the store can be branded differently and
have access to all or partial snaps list depending on the device you are playing with. This configuration is available
to board makers when then enable a new device with Snappy Ubuntu Core.

## Install snake!

Let's try to install your first package by simply clicking on **Install** next to *snake*. Once this is done, open a new
browser tab and head over http://webdm.local:9999/.

It's high time for you to perform new ground breaking records!

Installing (and removing) new snaps is that easy! Extend your system in a breath and get your router to perform your home
backups, monitoring and even regulating your average home temperature!

Of course, we have options for having this preinstalled when building a factory image and there is also a command line tool
available to perform similar operations.
