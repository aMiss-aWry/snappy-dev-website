# We centralize supported devices and variables mapping for this release in here.
# Those are per device specific instructions. Format in the markdown is:
# Optional variable substitution (will only trigger an info log): <<IMAGE_URL>>
# Required variable substitution (will trigger an error log, exit will be 1): [[IMAGE_URL]]
# Format is a yaml file, where primary key is the device id (used in url), and then key: value mapping, where key
# is used is the variable used in expanded files.

    ### Preparing the NUC (if using internal ROM as disk)
    > Note that this step is only necessary in case you want to install Ubuntu Core on the 4GB eMMC Built-In Storage.
    If you wired an ssd disk to your NUC, this section can be skipped.
    1. Start your NUC by pressing the On button while pressing F2 during the boot up, this will open the BIOS settings.
    1. On the initial screen, access the "advanced" tab and press to access the "Devices and Peripherals" Tab.
    1. On the "Devices and Peripherals" menu, under the "On board devices" submenu, make sure that the emmc checkbox ("4GB emmc Built-in Storage") is checked.
      > If you didn't find this option, this means that you need to update your NUC BIOS to latest version. For this, you can follow online instructions on the [Intel website](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/boards-and-kits/000005850.html).
    1. In the "Boot" menu, "Secure boot" submenu, make sure that the "secure boot" is not checked.
  EMMC_DISK_INSTRUCTIONS: >
    Please note that if you want to use the eMMC instead of an internal ssd drive, replace **/dev/sdX** by **/dev/mmcblk0**
    which refers to the eMMC option.
