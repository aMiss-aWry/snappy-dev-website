# We centralize supported devices and variables mapping for this release in here.
# Those are per device specific instructions. Format in the markdown is:
# Optional variable substitution (will only trigger an info log): <<IMAGE_URL>>
# Required variable substitution (will trigger an error log, exit will be 1): [[IMAGE_URL]]
# Format is a yaml file, where primary key is the device id (used in url), and then key: value mapping, where key
# is used is the variable used in expanded files.
