# We centralize supported devices and variables mapping for this release in here.
# Those are per device specific instructions. Format in the markdown is:
# Optional variable substitution (will only trigger an info log): <<IMAGE_URL>>
# Required variable substitution (will trigger an error log, exit will be 1): [[IMAGE_URL]]
# Format is a yaml file, where primary key is the device id (used in url), and then key: value mapping, where key
# is used is the variable used in expanded files.

    ADDITIONAL_FIRST_BOOT_NOTES: |
      Since we require our own boot loader in order to be fully compatible with Snappy, it's recommended to remove the bootloader available in the eMMC partition:
      * On first boot (or each boot if you don't want to erase the bootloader available at the eMMC), you can also force it to boot to the sd card by pressing the user/boot switch button before powering up the device.
      * Then, to remove the bootloader in the eMMC partition, you can run the following command on you Ubuntu Core system: `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=1024 count=1024`

  BIOS_INSTRUCTIONS: |
    ### Preparing the NUC (if using internal ROM as disk)
    > Note that this step is only necessary in case you want to install Ubuntu Core on the 4GB eMMC Built-In Storage.
    If you wired an ssd disk to your NUC, this section can be skipped.
    1. Start your NUC by pressing the On button while pressing F2 during the boot up, this will open the BIOS settings.
    1. On the initial screen, access the "advanced" tab and press to access the "Devices and Peripherals" Tab.
    1. On the "Devices and Peripherals" menu, under the "On board devices" submenu, make sure that the emmc checkbox ("4GB emmc Built-in Storage") is checked.
      > If you didn't find this option, this means that you need to update your NUC BIOS to latest version. For this, you can follow online instructions on the [Intel website](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/boards-and-kits/000005850.html).
    1. In the "Boot" menu, "Secure boot" submenu, make sure that the "secure boot" is not checked.
  EMMC_DISK_INSTRUCTIONS: >
    Please note that if you want to use the eMMC instead of an internal ssd drive, replace **/dev/sdX** by **/dev/mmcblk0**
    which refers to the eMMC option.

  SETUP_NOTES: |
    You can use an **USB card** or **disk drive** that you will attach to after installing Ubuntu Core on it.
    You will need to ensure that the boot order in BIOS/UEFI is set to try that USB storage or new disk first.
