# Setting up your [[DEVICE_NAME]]

![[[DEVICE_NAME]] image]([[DEVICE_IMG_URL]] "[[DEVICE_NAME]] image")

Installing Snappy Ubuntu Core on your [[DEVICE_NAME]], only takes 3 steps and a 2G USB key:
1. Install a live version of Ubuntu Classic on a USB key.
1. Boot on your [[DEVICE_NAME]] from the live USB key.
1. Install Ubuntu Core onto [[DEVICE_NAME]] disk from the live session.
And you can get started with your project!

> Make sure your board is connected to the same network as your computer to manage Ubuntu Core remotely via SSH, or has a screen and keyboard attached if you prefer managing Ubuntu Core directly on the board.
