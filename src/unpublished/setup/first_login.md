## First login to Ubuntu Core [[RELEASE_VERSION]]

Power on your [[DEVICE_NAME]] and wait a couple of minutes for the OS to complete its first boot. You can then access your snappy Ubuntu Core system either directly with a keyboard and display connected, or through SSH:
```sh
ssh ubuntu@webdm.local
```
The default *password* is **ubuntu**.

Congrats! You just installed your new Snappy Ubuntu Core [[RELEASE_VERSION]] system!
