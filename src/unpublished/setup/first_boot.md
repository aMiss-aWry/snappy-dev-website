## First boot to Ubuntu Core [[RELEASE_VERSION]]

> Note that the first boot can be longer than usual as your primary disk is repartioned to take all available free space.

Power on your [[DEVICE_NAME]] and wait a couple of minutes for the OS to complete its first boot.

You can then access your snappy Ubuntu Core system by loading the webdm interface from your browser. Just point it to
http://webdm.local:4200.

> Remember that if your device/cloud isn't on the same network or your vm use port redirection, adapt **webm.local** and
> the port with the appropriate external IP and ports.
