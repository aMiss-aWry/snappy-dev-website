From your desktop computer, you can download and install a pre-built Snappy Ubuntu Core [[RELEASE_VERSION]] image for your [[DEVICE_NAME]] and copy it to an SD card. You can then get started with your project!

> Make sure your board is connected to the same network as your computer to manage Ubuntu Core remotely via SSH, or has a screen and keyboard attached if you prefer managing Ubuntu Core directly on the board.
